## Retrospective Service
This project is a RESTful web service implemented in Java using Spring Boot. It allows users to capture and query retrospective outcomes, which are used in SCRUM ceremonies to reflect on software delivery during (sprints). The service provides endpoints for creating new retrospectives, adding feedback items to retrospectives, updating feedback items, and searching retrospectives.

## Tools and Libraries Used
Java (IDE- IntelliJ)
Spring Boot
Maven
JUnit and Mockito
Postman: A tool for testing and interacting with the RESTful endpoints.

## Unit Testing
The application includes unit tests to ensure the correctness of the implemented endpoints. You can run the tests using the following command:

Run RetrospectiveApplicationTests.java

Retrospective data is stored in memory and will be lost on application restart.
The application follows RESTful principles, using appropriate HTTP methods for each endpoint.
Pagination is supported for the search endpoints, allowing retrieval of retrospectives in chunks.
